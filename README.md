 # Documentation
 
 There are three classes:
 
 - DrawBox.java class consists of having the method that draws the box 
 - DisplayBox.java consists of the main method and calling the DrawBox.java class to run the program. This class has the values where you 
 can input such as 4x4 box.
 - Tests.java class conists of using JUnit Testing to validate the main method to know if the code is running exactly how it should, 
 
 Please Note: The output of this is shown in the console and does not have an UI. This will be a future improvement.
